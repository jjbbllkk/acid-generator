# ACID PATTERN GENERATOR

**A deterministic, musically-aware acid bassline generator.**

This is a fork of [drakh/acid-generator](https://github.com/drakh/acid-generator), heavily inspired by the [**STING by SKINNERBOX**](https://maxforlive.com/library/device/4260/sting-by-skinnerbox) Max for Live device.

Unlike standard random generators, this version focuses on **musical stability and reproducibility**. It uses seeded random number generation and weighted probability to ensure that "random" patterns feel like cohesive musical phrases rather than chaotic noise.

## New Features & Changes

### Deterministic & Musical Generation
* **Seed-Based Logic:** The generator is now fully deterministic. Every pattern is generated from a unique seed. If you find a pattern you like, it will sound exactly the same every time you load it.
* **Weighted "Musical" Probability:** The generator no longer picks notes purely at random. It uses a tonal hierarchy:
    * **Root & Fifth Priority:** The generator favors the root and fifth notes of the scale, especially on downbeats, to "anchor" the bassline.
    * **Rhythmic Stability:** Downbeats (steps 1, 5, 9, 13) are prioritized when generating rhythms to establish a strong groove.
    * **Intelligent Resolution:** "Wonky" intervals are mathematically forced to resolve to stable tones on the "One" (the first beat of the bar).

### Smarter Knobs
* **Density as a Mask:** Changing `Density` no longer regenerates a new random pattern. Instead, it acts as a "Rhythmic Gate," revealing or hiding notes from a fixed "Master Sequence." Turning it down removes the funkier off-beats first; turning it up reveals them.
* **Spread as a Pool:** Changing `Spread` controls the *pool* of allowed notes. Lower settings restrict the melody to just the Root and Fifth. Higher settings unlock the full scale. This allows you to simplify a melody without changing its fundamental rhythm.
* **Loop Length Independence:** Changing the `Pattern Length` (e.g., from 16 to 7) does not regenerate the notes. It simply loops a smaller section of the 64-step master sequence.

### Extended Audio Engine
* **New Synth Controls:** Added **Envelope Mod** (Env) and **Decay** controls to the interface, allowing for deeper, squelchier TB-303 style sound design.
* **Visual Feedback:** The piano roll now visually dims steps that are outside the active loop length.
* **Expanded Scales:** Added Pentatonic Minor/Major, Blues Minor, Whole Tone, Chromatic, and Japanese In Sen scales.

## USAGE

* **Space:** Start/Stop playback.
* **G (or Click Smile):** Generate a completely new pattern (new Seed).
* **Knobs:**
    * **Density:** Add/remove rhythmic events.
    * **Spread:** Add/remove melodic complexity.
    * **Env / Decay / Cut / Res:** Shape the synth tone.
